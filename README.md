## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- CSS modules - For styles
- REST API 

### What I learned

- create functional and class components in react
- use callbacks to lift up data
- use API to get data
- divide componnents and styles
- use react router
- JSX Syntax

### Useful resources

- [deploy React App when using React Router](https://medium.com/@arijit_chowdhury/deploy-react-app-with-react-router-to-github-pages-for-free-569377f483f) - this page helped me why my page after deploy loaded only navigation component, which was out of react router.
